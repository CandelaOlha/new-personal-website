# Personal website

## About this project

This is a website I made with the aim of showing my work as a Frontend Developer.

I used Figma to create a minimal design and then turned it into reality with HTML, CSS and a bit of Vanilla Javascript.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Design resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for prototyping
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/es/create) for color picking
- [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons

In this case, I wanted to make an impact by using a remarkable typeface. So I downloaded the "Circular St" font instead of using the ones from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), which I usually choose for my projects.
